#1 Mission: Create a directory named Arena and then inside it, create three files: warrior.txt, mage.txt, and archer.txt. List the contents of the Arena directory.
mkdir -p Arena

#2 Create a script that outputs the numbers 1 to 10, one number per line.

#3 Mission: Write a script that checks if a file named hero.txt exists in the Arena directory. If it does, print Hero found!; otherwise, print Hero missing!

#4 Create a script that copies all .txt files from the Arena directory to a new directory called Backup.
mkdir Backup

#5 Mission: Combine what you've learned! Write a script that:

#1. Creates a directory names 'Battlefield'
#2. Inside Battlefield, create files named knight.txt, sorcerer.txt, and rogue.txt.
#3. Check if knight.txt exists; if it does, move it to a new directory called Archive.
#4. List the contents of both Battlefield and Archive.

#8 Create a script that searches for a specific word or phrase across all .log files in a directory and outputs the names of the files that contain the word or phrase.

#Creates 5 text files inside the directory, named file1.txt to file5.txt.
#Generates a random number of lines (between 10 and 20) in each file.
#Sorts these files by their size and displays the list.
